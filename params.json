A link will be provided as soon\r\nas the manuscriupt becomes available.\r\n\r\nWe will improve the documentation and hope that this project will\r\nmature to an implementation that can be used more easily by everyone.\r\n\r\nHow to replicate the results\r\n============================\r\n\r\nThe reference implementations of RMHMC, HMC and SMMALA require the\r\nmatlab toolbox [SBPOP](http://www.sbtoolbox2.org/main.php) to be\r\ninstalled.\r\n\r\nThe steady state adapted algorithms do not integrate the model and do\r\nnot require this package.\r\n\r\nThe model files for the steady state adapted algorithms (NR prefix)\r\nhave been built using octave forge's [symbolic package](http://octave.sourceforge.net/symbolic/). \r\nHowever, the symbolic calculations required can be done using any other\r\nsoftware capable of symbolic calculations.\r\n\r\nThe models are named _MAPK_, _Mma_ and _Mifa_. You will find setup files for\r\neach of them (called ```MAPKsetup.m```, ```MmaSetup.m``` and\r\n```MifaSetup.m```). These files set variables that are not algorithm\r\nspecific. But some of the values may impact an algorithm's performance\r\n(such as the step size).\r\n\r\nIf your SBPOP package is installed correctly you should be able to run\r\nthe procedures called ```Run_«model»_using_«algorithm».m```.\r\n\r\nThe only files you need to investigate are the setup files. They\r\ncontain prior setups, step sizes and sample sizes.\r\n\r\nInspect the simulation results\r\n===============================\r\n\r\nYou have acces to the values of all defined options as used by us\r\nduring sampling by loading the ```.mat``` files in the ```Results```\r\nfolders and checking the options variable.\r\n\r\nHow to set up your own example\r\n==============================\r\n\r\nThis is not very convenient yet, since a lot of the model setup is not\r\nautomated. If you wish to try it out anyway, then inspect the\r\n```symmodel``` octave files, e.g. ```Models/Insulin/Mma_symmodel.m```\r\nand adjust them to your needs. If you wish you can also inspect the\r\nmodel files themselves, e.g. ```make_Mma_model.m``` and produce a\r\nsimilar file for your model using Maple, Maxima, Mathematica or any\r\nother symbolic software package.\r\n\r\nIf you really want to compare performance, you will have to build an\r\nSBToolBox2 model file as well. But, keep in mind, that the proposed\r\nmethod (using Newton Raphson and steady state sensitivity analysis)\r\nshould be strictly superior to the reference implementation in all\r\ncases (the drawback beeing the restriction to steady states). So,\r\nthere is no need to compare RMHMC to the steady state adapted version\r\ndescribed in the publication. You will probably want to compare this\r\nmethod to the one you have been using in the past.\r\n\r\nFiles\r\n=====\r\n\r\nAll files not mentioned here have been used to process the results and\r\nneed not necessarily be investigated but are provided nevertheless for\r\nthe curious.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
